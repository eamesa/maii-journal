title: What I learned from Class 2. More Koans and Exercism.
---

## Ruby Koans 
I have to learn how to look up for methods that translate easier ways to translate the logic of solving a problem to code.
dice.tally # tally the number of rolls on each dice...turn into a hash and read the keys, this solves the problem of having to go through all possible combinations of 55511, 51155, 551115, etc.

## Exercism

## Maii Update
The iteration for the buttons was in the wrong place,  the params hash was only taking the last element because the form was only generated once. Now each button is a different form so it has a unique participation_id. 
Remember to refactor Maii to include the loose ends we saw at the end of class.
