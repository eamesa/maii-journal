## Learn about Git

**never commit directly on main**...branch out -> commit to the branch -> review the code and merge on main

https://chapters.firstdraft.com/chapters/859

Command line git
- git commit
- git checkout to create a new branch `git checkout -b new-branch-name`
- git checkout to switch to a branch `git checkout branch-name`
- git merge
- git rebase

## Scaffold generator

`rails generate scaffold movie title:string description:text`

the scaffold generator is similar to the draft resource generator, but more advanced. From now on we only use scaffold.

## Adding users with Devise

https://chapters.firstdraft.com/chapters/880

Devise defines the current_user method which return the current user. We have to use this to customize the views or even the allowed actions.
`#before_action :must_be_admin, only [:edit, :update, :destroy]` will only allow users which admin == true to edit, update or destroy books.
