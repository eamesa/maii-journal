title: Three things I learned from The Ruby Koans
---

Here are (at least) three things I learned from [The Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com/):

-Ruby is hard!

-assert test, "error message"
-For Arrays array[2,5] means start at the element 2 and take 5 elements.

> assert_equal [1,2,3,4,5], (1..5).to_a
> assert_equal [1,2,3,4], (1...5).to_a
