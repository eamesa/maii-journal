Change html dinamicaly using JS

<script>
          
</script>

## Variables and strings
-JavaScript uses camelCase
-// 1) names only contain letters, numbers, symbol $ _
- // 2) first character must not be a number
- Boolean variables: isVariable
- SHOUTING_SNAKE_CASE when a constant holds a value not to be changed

var / cons / let: declare the intention of the variable you are creating and minimize errors by using the correct type of declaration

String interpolation: similar to Ruby's #{string} but it uses ${string}. 

## Types and conditionals

```
if (boolean) {
 //block of code that runs if boolean = true
} elseif (boolean2 === 'condition') {
 //block that ruins if boolean2 = true
 }
} else {
 //block that ruins if boolean = false
 }
 ```
